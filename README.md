# Description

MCCGalleryView is a simple gallery ScrollView for iOS.

MCCGalleryView allows you to easily create a Photo app kind of horizontal paging view to show pictures or any other content.


## Features

* Pages are cached and recycled, much like in UITableView.
* No delegation protocol, MCCGalleryView use callback blocks for creation and recycling of pages.
* Very easy to integrate: 2 blocks, the number of pages, you're all set!
* No protocol for pages, they only need to be of UIView kind.
* Register for scrolling event or singleTap etc... using blocks.


## Usage

```objective-c

__block MCCGalleryView *gv = [[[MCCGalleryView alloc]initWithFrame:aFrame]autorelease];
 
gv.pagesCount = numberOfPages;
   
gv.pageBlock = ^UIView *(NSUInteger pageIndex) {
  /* Return a page for pageIndex */    
};
   
gv.recycleBlock = ^NSString *(UIView *page) {
  /* Return a reuse identifier (also release memory) */
};
   
/* Load the pages */
[gv loadPages];

```


## Events

You probably don't need to subclass MCCGalleryView since you can register using block callbacks for events: 

* onScrollViewDidScroll
* onVisibleRangeChanged
* onSingleTap
* onDoubleTap

Example:

```objective-c
gv.onSingleTap = ^{
  [self togglePager];
};

gv.onVisibleRangeChanged = ^(NSRange newRange) {
  [self updatePagerWithIndex:newRange.location];
}
```
